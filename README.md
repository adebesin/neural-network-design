Single Input Neuron
-------------------

let *p* = scalar input  
let *w* = weight  
let *b* = bias  
let *n* = net input  
let *f* = transfer function  
let *a* = scalar neuron output  

*n = wp + b*  
*f(n) --> a*

Summation occurs at *wp + b*. The weight *w* has a constant value of 1. Both the weight *w* 
and bias *b* are adjustable scalar values.
